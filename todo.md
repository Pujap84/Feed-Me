<!-- By Lunch:
Planning complete
   [x] Wireframes done
   [x] User stories completed and checked with me (making sure weâ€™re not trying to do too much :))
    [x] Database schema complete and checked with me (having a solid database design can help a lot, especially with deployment to Heroku)


By EOD:
Depending on how you decided to split the work, this goal is more of a guide:
    [x] Everyone has a basic app skeleton forked and pulled down from Github
    [x] Everyone has submitted at least one pull request to their main repo and this was merged
    [x] Database set up locally for all members
    [] Basic express app with database pushed to Heroku by gitlord
        - When recipe book feature implemented
    [] One model complete with REST API on backend
        - User model
            - Model: User.js
            - Middleware: validate_user.js, error handler, logger
            - Controllers: users_controller.js

    [] Front end has a good base with any JavaScript and CSS files being included.
        - JS
            - User login form
            - User signup
            - Navbar
        - CSS

    [] Starting work on one of your user stories. -->
